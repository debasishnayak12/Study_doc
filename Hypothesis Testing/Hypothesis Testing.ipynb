    "A test that assumes that data has a normal distribution.\n",

The danger is that if we say that we “accept” the null hypothesis, the language suggests that the null hypothesis is true. Instead, it is safer to say that we “fail to reject” the null hypothesis, as in, there is insufficient statistical evidence to reject it.\n",

    "When reading “reject” vs “fail to reject” for the first time, it is confusing to beginners. You can think of it as “reject” vs “accept” in your mind, as long as you remind yourself that the result is probabilistic and that even an “accepted” null hypothesis still has a small probability of being wrong."

    "The interpretation of a statistical hypothesis test is probabilistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means that the evidence of the test may suggest an outcome and be mistaken.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if alpha was 5%, it suggests that (at most) 1 time in 20 that the null hypothesis would be mistakenly rejected or failed to be rejected because of the statistical noise in the data sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a small p-value (reject the null hypothesis) either means that the null hypothesis false (we got it right) or it is true and some rare and unlikely event has been observed (we made a mistake). If this type of error is made, it is called a false positive. We falsely believe the rejection of the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternately, given a large p-value (fail to reject the null hypothesis), it may mean that the null hypothesis is true (we got it right) or that the null hypothesis is false and some unlikely event occurred (we made a mistake). If this type of error is made, it is called a false negative. We falsely believe the null hypothesis or assumption of the statistical test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these two types of error has a specific name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type I Error: The incorrect rejection of a true null hypothesis or a false positive.\n",
    "Type II Error: The incorrect failure of rejection of a false null hypothesis or a false negative.\n",
    "All statistical hypothesis tests have a chance of making either of these types of errors. False findings or false disoveries are more than possible; they are probable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we want to choose a significance level that minimizes the likelihood of one of these errors. E.g. a very small significance level. Although significance levels such as 0.05 and 0.01 are common in many fields of science, harder sciences, such as physics, are more aggressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to use a significance level of 3 * 10^-7 or 0.0000003, often referred to as 5-sigma. This means that the finding was due to chance with a probability of 1 in 3.5 million independent repeats of the experiments. To use a threshold like this may require a much large data sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, these types of errors are always present and must be kept in mind when presenting and interpreting the results of statistical tests. It is also a reason why it is important to have findings independently verified."
